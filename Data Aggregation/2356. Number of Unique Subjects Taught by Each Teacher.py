(subject_id, dept_id) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with teacher_id teaches the subject subject_id in the department dept_id.
 

Write a solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.

Return the result table in any order.



Solution:
import pandas as pd

def count_unique_subjects(teacher: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = teacher.groupby('teacher_id')['subject_id'].nunique().reset_index()
    return df.rename(columns = {'subject_id' : 'cnt'})
